                <p>Socialization is important for all social beings out there and that includes your companion animals! Pet socialization is something that all pet parents should strongly consider, especially when you adopt a new puppy or kitten!</p>
                <p>So what is Pet socialization? It is the process of teaching pets to enjoy interacting with other animals, people, places, and activities. Right now, this may be difficult because of social distancing, but keep in mind that pet socialization is necessary for young puppies and kittens. It will prevent your babies from having fears, anxiety, and aggressive behavior. This process will enable your little paw friends to get used to the environment and live confidently and happily without fear or insecurity.</p>
                <p>Pet socialization should begin when your pet is in a sensitive period, 3-14 weeks old for puppies and 3-9 weeks old for kittens. It is when they are most open to learning about their surroundings.</p>

            <section class="socialization-text2">
                <p>Allow your pet to choose whether or not to participate in an activity. Your little friend is supposed to enjoy these positive experiences without being forced to do so. Don't make your pet do something they don't want to, because it can cause mental issues that can lead to behavioral issues in the future.</p>

                <p>Since childhood, it is necessary to cultivate a positive attitude, reduce stress, anxiety, and aggressive behavior. Pet socialization may not be as easy as you would like at firts, but practice makes perfect! It is a crucial beginning for your darling pet to learn about the world and live a happy life with you!</p>
