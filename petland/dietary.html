                <p>It's not uncommon to want to spoil your dog by sharing table scraps or your favorite people food snack instead of a dog treat. After all, if it is safe for you to eat, it must be OK for your dog to eat, right? Not necessarily. While many people foods are perfectly safe for dogs, some are very unhealthy and downright dangerous, so it's critical to learn which fruits and vegetables dogs can eat.</p>
                <p>Dogs digest foods differently than humans do, and eating the wrong foods can lead dogs to long-term health problems and, in extreme cases, even death. As omnivores, dogs have no real need for fruits or vegetables as part of their diet, but an occasional fruit or veggie as a treat is OK. Fresh dog foods also pre-portion fresh veggies into meals. Read on to find out which fruits and vegetables are OK for sharing in moderation and which should be avoided.</p>
                <p>Dogs can eat raspberries. Raspberries are fine in moderation. They contain antioxidants that are great for dogs. They're low in sugar and calories, but high in fiber, manganese, and vitamin C. Raspberries are especially good for senior dogs because they have anti-inflammatory properties, which can help aging joints. However, they do contain small amounts of xylitol, so limit your dog to less than a cup of raspberries at a time.</p>

                <p>Otherwise, dogs should avoid tomatoes. While the ripened fruit of the tomato plant is generally considered safe for dogs, the green parts of the plant contain a toxic substance called solanine. While a dog would need to eat a large amount of the tomato plant to make him or her sick, it's better to skip tomatoes all together just to be safe.</p>
                <p>Pets should always get most of their daily nutritional requirement from a balanced, quality commercial pet food.</p>
